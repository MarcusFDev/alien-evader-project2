# Alien Evader

[Alien Evader](https://marcusfdev.github.io/alien-evader-project2/) has been designed as a cartoon platformer game. Users control a little alien attempting to evade their parent's spaceship as long as they can using the building rooftops. Users can build up score the longer they remain uncaught, they are to be mindful however, the longer they remain evading, the faster the chase becomes. 

The site has been themed alongside the game and is aimed to be responsive on all devices with the addition of a Feedback form, so users can send in their own ideas with the goal of community building.

## Visual Design

### Wireframes

Wireframes: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E2rB4CANWpOGZ9mtItdcmlkzKCoB5-LR?usp=sharing

### Fonts

![Site Font Example](assets/images/site-images/site-font-example.png)

 - The primary font used on the website & game assets was [Madimi One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Madimi+One). This font was chosen as the main font because it really gave off the impression it felt at place with cartoon style graphics. It's bubble like appearance really sat well with the other graphics on the page while maintaining a certain level of professionalism. On a practical note, the font is clear & easy to read on all devices and is not harsh on the eyes in any way. While there are other fonts with similiar styles Madimi One was picked to be the best for the job. The font styles well for all text on the page as by design, large bodies of text are not common on the Alien Evader site instead relying on a graphical and simplistic approach. 

 - The secondary font for the website [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) was picked for it's easy readability and playful style. It is not harsh to look at, and when styled correctly using higher values it looks very alike the primary font's style. It is inviting to all users and fits the cartoon style of the site almost as well.

### Icons

![Site Icon Example](assets/images/site-images/site-icon-example.png)

 -  Icons used throughout the website were taken from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) icon library. They are utilized in the `<i>` tag.
 -  Icons are used in the navigational Bar & Footer as well as in other assets and pages on the site such as thankyou.html & the 404.html page. They were used to create a more visually appealing site. Appropriate use of icons was done to also visually help users navigate the webpages.

### Colors

![Site Color Palette](assets/images/site-images/site-color-palette.png)

- When designing Alien Evaders, the goal was to create an enviroment for a little Alien to jump across rooftops. Night time was considered to be the best backdrop for the game and so a color palette was deisgned around that in mind. Each color was picked to contrast and compliment each other. As the site needed to match the game's theme, that was also kept in mind when colors were chosen.
- The deep blue color on the palette, Oxford Blue or #08193B, was chosen as the night sky. It was felt that this blue was the most suitable, indicating a dark enviroment that would contrast perfectly to the more vibrant colors both on the game and on the webpages. It was important to use the color appropriately otherwise, the site would appear far too dark, hard to read and overbearing for users.
- The White-like color, Platinum or #E5E5E5, was used to directly contrast and match the dark themes of Oxford Blue, to brighten up the page. That is fitting as this color was used as the Moon assets and the stars in the night sky. This color was the best kind of white to use as it was not too bright on the eyes but not too dull either.
- Pigment Green or #4C9D44 was one of the colors chosen for the Alien character and a support color for text and some elements on the pages. It was often used as borders to contrast the Oxford Blue. This particular green was chosen, as the common trope for aliens in media are green and this site was designed around the little green alien, it was important to use a green not too dark or not to light. It was a conscious choice to use the green mostly sparingly as a supporting color and a highlight, because it helps the user focus on the character while playing the game.
- Two purples were used both on the site and on the game assets of Alien Evader, Royal Purple & Amethyst or #8259B0 & #9457D9 respectively. These colors were used quite frequently as font-color as they contrasted well with the Oxford Blue backgrounds and the Pigment Green borders. Royal Purple was introduced to the site for better accessibility where the Amethyst coloring did not contrast as well with the Platinum coloring. Instead the Amethyst coloring was used on other assets most notably the Alien's legs.

### Site Backgrounds

![Site Star Background](assets/images/site-images/night-sky-art.webp)

Star & Night Sky Background

- Like every asset on Alien Evader, this was hand created using [Affinity Designer 2](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/). Utilizing Oxford Blue for the sky & Platinum for the Moon & stars.
- It felt natural to use this as the main site background, and used quite frequently for styling other parts of the site such as the feedback section.

![Site Asset Background](assets/images/site-images/site-background.webp)

Game Section Wallpaper

- This image was used as the background for the game section on the page. It compiles multiple game assets onto an image as a wallpaper. Using it behind the game section in index.html, allows the section have a interesting background while not looking out of place or too distracting for users playing the game. It is most noticable on Laptop & Desktop sized screens.   
---

![Site Header & Footer Background](assets/images/site-images/site-header-img.webp)

Header & Footer Wallpaper

- This image was used as the background image for the Header & Footer elements, alongside some other elements on the webpages. It references the style the moon which matches the one found in game.
- The purpose of using this image, was to give the elements that uses it, such as the Header & Footer, a texture styling so that they are not one singular solid color. It makes these elements match the page styling so much better.

### Other Site Assets

There are a large amount of custom made assets made for Alien Evader. To view these assets please see the Google Drive folder here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xaAKbgmLqbPimEjjYu5Sn4fLmKJ2nkPO?usp=sharing

# Features

## Page Elements

### All Web Pages

### Header & Navigational Bar

![Site Header & Navigational Bar](assets/images/site-images/site-headernav-img.png)

- The Header & Navigational bar is located on every page of the website. It was designed to match the cartoon style of the game, while being clear and concise. It provides a link to the Home page and a shortcut to the feedback section on the page.
- The Header itself is a link to the Home page when clicked. 
- The Home button is given a `.active` class to indicate when the user's on that page.
- The links have been given a hover affect for better user interactivity. 
- The Navigational bar was deisgned with easy expansion in mind if more pages are required.
- It is responsive to the device viewport. 

### Footer

![Site Footer Image](assets/images/site-images/site-footerlarge-img.png)

- The Footer is located on every page of the website. It is designed to match the Header & Navigational bar, and fit the style of the page perfectly. 
- The Footer's purpose is to contain links to the social medias of the Alien Evader community. It also has the copyright message below the social media buttons. 
- The Footer was inspired by the ["Love Running"](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/login?next=/courses/course-v1%3ACodeInstitute%2BLRFX101%2B2023_Q2/courseware/e805068059af42af87681032aa64053f/7525117e5cd144daa2a7b0c57843bbee/) project by Code Institute. Any code taken was modified and styled for the Alien Evader website in mind adding buttons and a highlight feature, alongside the copyright information to indivudualize this site's footer.
- When hovering over a button with a mouse in the Footer, it highlights the icon. This is done for aesthetic purposes giving the user more interaction on the site. 
- On larger screens such as Desktop the buttons have pairing text with them underneath.

![Site Footer Image Mobile](assets/images/site-images/site-footersmall-img.png)

- The Footer is responsive to viewports. On smaller screens such as Mobile the text is hidden to conserve space for users.

### Index Page

- The site has been designed so that this is the Main page of Alien Evader. It is where site users will spend majority of their time as both the Phaser JavaScript game & feedback form is located on it. The `index.html` has been designed simply, to not overwhelm the user once they come onto the website, and has been carefully designed to match the aesthic of the game.
- The first section contains the Alien Evader game canvas itself. 

![Site Feedback Form](assets/images/site-images/site-feedbackform-img.png)

- The second section is for the feedback form where users can fill in a form to submit feedback & give their suggestions for game ideas.
- Using the attributes `type=""` & `required` all fields must be filled in correctly before the form is submitted.
- If the form has been filled out correctly and the submit button has been clicked it will send users to the `thankyou.html` page.

### The Alien Evader Game

The Alien Evader game was created using the [Phaser](https://phaser.io) Framework. The Game is divided into multiple `scenes` and imported into the `<script.js>` file. Alien Evader uses `<div>` as buttons which have been styled using CSS & custom assets as images. 

While an effort was made to have the game completely functional on all devices, unforeseen issues arose with the Phaser code causing the scene background images to not appear as they should and due to the problem not being fixable for the project deadline; the game may not yet be working as intended on Mobile and Tablet sized devices.

The Game Menu Scene

- The Play button changes the `scene` and allows the user to begin the game.
- The How to Play button sends the user to a new `scene` revealing a styled `<div>` providing instructions of how to play.
- The Audio button switches on & off the music for the game, by default the audio is off. 

Regarding Audio, an attempt was made to give the jump an audio sound. Due to a bug causing the audio button not to function correctly with the jump sound in place, the jump sound was removed and pushed to Feature ideas. The jump sound was referenced in Credits.

![Alien Evader Menu image](assets/images/site-images/site-gamecanvas-img.png)

The Game Scene

- Users can control the alien with `A & D` or `Left & Right Arrow` keys and `Space` to Jump. 
- Users are to jump across the buildings and not fall down. Two game over conditions exist, one for falling down between the buildings & one if you hit the left side of the canvas.
- Buildings act as platforms, 7 variations of buildings were designed and randomly are created utilizing an array in `game.js`.
- Score increases over time the longer the game is active and gives the user a reason to keep playing. 

![Alien Evader Game image](assets/images/site-images/site-game-img.png)

The Game Over Scene

- Users final score result appears on the page. 
- A restart button was implemented for a better user experience.
- A Menu button appears so that users can return to the main menu of the game.

![Alien Evader Game Over image](assets/images/site-images/site-gameover-img.png)

## Additional Site Features

### Thank You Page

- Upon a user successfully submitting a form, the webpage changes to the `thankyou.html` webpage.
- This page was designed to communicate to the user that their feedback was collected by the system.
- The Thank You page was styled with the header and footer of `index.html` maintaining the same theme in uniform with the rest of the site.
- It provides a go back button for users to easily navigate back to the home page.
- It is responsive to the device viewport.
- Due to a bug identified to be caused by the Phaser framework and conscious of the time scope of the project, incorporating the [jQuery](https://jquery.com) Framework was needed to successfully read a completed form & change the webpage from `index.html` to `thankyou.html`. 

It was intended to use [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com) to send the user an email for when they submitted a successful form. However due to issues with the functionality of EmailJS on their website and keeping in mind the scope & time of The Alien Evader project, this was pushed to Feature Ideas.

![Thank you page image](assets/images/site-images/site-thankyou-img.png)

### Notice Message

With the current unexpected issues with the Alien Evader game on Mobile & Tablet devices, and the solution being out of reach for the project deadline. The decision was made to create a Notice message for users on Mobile & Tablet devices, letting users be aware of the current issues with the functionality of the game on their device. 

- On the DOM load if the JavaScript detects a user is on a screen width of 800px or less, a `<div>` element will appear above the game container.
- A dismiss button is provided to users to remove the message from the site.
- The Message is styled for Tablet & Phone devices 

![Notice Message](assets/images/site-images/site-notice-img.png)

### 404 Error Page

 - Customized 404 error page for website if a page the user is attempting to find is not located.
 - Used 404.html file and styled to match the rest of the website.
 - Provided a brief explaination to the user and provided a Return Home button so that the user may return to the Home page.
 - Return button highlights if a mouse hovers over it.
 - Added a contact support email if problem persists for the user.
 - 404 Error page is responsive to viewport and is readable and accessible to all devices.

![Lighthouse Testing image](assets/images/site-images/site-lighthouse-result.png)

### General Testing

- After every alteration that was made to the code, everything was prompty tested to check for change.
- Feedback form will not submit until all fields are correctly filled in. 
- All External links work and open in seperate tabs.
- Both the Home & Feedback internal buttons work and send to their respective pages.
- Tablet & Mobile notice message works on those devices, hidden on larger screens.
- Dismiss button works to remove notice message.
- 404 page works correctly.
- Thank you page works correctly.
- Any backup features added were tested and work as intended.
- The website appears to function correctly in different browsers: Chrome, OperaGX, Microsoft Edge.
- Using Chrome Developer tools, site responsiveness was tested for all major device sizes.

## Bugs

### Known Bugs

- Phaser Game Canvas not appropriately aligning background with screen width changes. Potentially the sizing of assets need to be changed within code & potentially new assets created for screen sizes specifically.
- The Notice message on Mobile & Tablet devices when dismiss it hit, the game begins playing. 
- Phaser event listenors potentially affecting other JavaScript on the page resulting unexpected outcomes/failures.

### Fixed Bugs

- Resolved an issue where the Notice message dismiss button would not work at all. Adding a `.hidden` class in the Mobile & Tablet Media Querys in the CSS allowed the `.hidden` to function correctly.

![Hidden Element Bug image](assets/images/site-images/site-hiddenbug-img.png)

- Resolved an issue where the game buttons would not work on touchscreen devices. Adding event listenors for touchscreens gave them functionality.

![Touchscreen Bug image](assets/images/site-images/site-touchscreenbug.png)

- Resolved a problem that caused the feedback form not to send a user to `thankyou.html` identified to be a bug caused from the Phaser code. The solution was to implement the jQuery framework. 

![Feedback Submit bug image](assets/images/site-images/site-jquery-bugfix.png)

- Resolved a issue that caused all buttons to be non functional on on touchscreen devices. Another Phaser related issue, updated to the most recent Phaser Framework which fixed the bug.
